# 1. Basic Charting

## Objectives
- Work with real world CSV data
- Know how to create a line graph using matplotlib
- Manipulate data to get the minimum and maximum temperature
- Demonstrate procedure of composite charts

# 2. Charting Fundamentals

## Objectives
- Build more complex features using base features (i.e., artists)
- Create new ways of visualizing the data by expanding the matplotlib codebase
- Use subplots to combine plots into a single figure
- Create insightful plots such as histograms, box plots, and histograms
- Create animated and interactive visualizations

# 3. Applied Visualizations

## Objectives
- Identify two publicly accessible datasets from the same region that are consistent across a meaningful dimension
- State a research question that can be answered using two publicly accessible datasets
- Create a visual using matplotlib that addresses your stated research question
- Justify how the visual addresses your research question

# 4. Becoming an Independent Data Scientist
